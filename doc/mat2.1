.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mat2
removes metadata from various fileformats. It supports a wide variety of file
formats, audio, office, images, â€¦

Careful, mat2 does not clean files in-place, instead, it will produce a file with the word
"cleaned" between the filename and its extension, for example "filename.cleaned.png"
for a file named "filename.png".
